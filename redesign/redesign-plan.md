# Blank-Slate UI Redesign Plan: wedding-planning

This is the project's working copy of `~/.claude/playbooks/blank-slate-redesign.md`, copied on 2026-10-14. From here on this file is the plan. Tick the checklist here, not in the global template.

A process for redesigning this project's UI from scratch, as if it were a brand-new product nobody has seen, while still covering everything the current app can do.

---

## Project details (filled in at Step 0)

**Base branch:** `main`. Every push to `main` deploys to production on Vercel, so all rebuild work stays on the `redesign` branch until Phase 8.

**Codebase path:** `/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning`. **Studio path:** `/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning-studio`.

### Source files for the inventory (taken from the code, 2026-10-14)
- **Shell, navigation and PWA:** `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx` (dashboard), `src/app/manifest.ts`, `src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx`, `src/components/layout/sw-register.tsx`, `public/sw.js`
- **Auth:** `src/app/login/page.tsx`, `src/lib/auth-context.tsx` (Google popup, email/password sign-in and registration), `src/lib/firebase.ts`, `firestore.rules`
- **Pages:** `src/app/{budget,checklist,confirmed,files,guests,master-list,notes,schedule,settings,shortlist,todo,vendors,venues}/page.tsx`
- **Feature components:** `src/components/{master-list,notes,shortlist,vendors,venues,shared}/**`, `src/components/cloudinary-upload-button.tsx`
- **Editors and formulas:** `src/components/notes/rich-text-editor.tsx`, `src/components/notes/formulas.ts`
- **Data layer (plumbing, kept in the rebuild):** `src/lib/collections/*.ts`, `src/lib/use-collection.ts`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/confirmed-sub-entries.ts`, `src/lib/schedule.ts`, `src/lib/format.ts`
- **Exports and file handling:** `src/lib/compress-pdf.ts` (jsPDF / pdf.js), `public/pdf.worker.min.mjs`, Cloudinary uploads
- **Primitives (UI layer, replaced in the rebuild):** `src/components/ui/*` (shadcn on Base UI), `src/app/globals.css`
- **Tests:** none in the repo. Step 8 has to write the behaviour checklist from scratch.
- **Behaviour history:** the change log in `AGENTS.md` and the `*-implementation-plan.md` / `*-prompt.md` files at the repo root (owner-only context; they describe the old UI, so they never enter the handoff).

### Project constraints (for Step 6)
- **Framework:** Next.js 16.2 App Router, React 19.2, TypeScript. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code (see `AGENTS.md`).
- **Styling today:** Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn (`components.json`), Base UI, lucide icons, tw-animate-css. The rebuild may keep or drop any of these; the design guide decides.
- **Build step:** `npm run build`; lint with `npm run lint`.
- **Data backend:** Firebase Firestore (client SDK, realtime listeners) and Firebase Auth; files on Cloudinary (unsigned upload preset). Firebase Hosting only serves a stub (`public-firebase-stub/`).
- **Hosting and deploy:** Vercel project `wedding-planning` (team `gregorykurnia-8729s-projects`), Node 24. Every push to `main` deploys to production; other branches get preview deploys.
- **Repo rule:** `CLAUDE.md` commits and pushes after every change, and `AGENTS.md` needs a change-log entry per change. During the rebuild, push to `redesign`, not `main`.

### Domain words allowed in the inventory
wedding, guest, plus-one, RSVP, headcount, family (groom's / bride's side), business connections, event, venue, vendor, vendor category, shortlist, package, quote, price option, contract, booking, confirmed, hypothetical, budget, real budget spent, pending spend, funder, payment, installment, deposit, due date, payment reminder, to-do, checklist, schedule, agenda, master list, notes, table, formula, files, folder, attachment, PDF, gallery, settings.

### Live URLs and repo (for deny rules and the firewall check)
- **Repo:** `https://github.com/gregorykurnia/wedding-planning`
- **Deployments:** `https://wedding-planning-*-gregorykurnia-8729s-projects.vercel.app` (for example `wedding-planning-h7ufo8ye1-gregorykurnia-8729s-projects.vercel.app`). No custom domains on the team.
- **Stable production alias:** `wedding-planning-gregorykurnia-8729s-projects.vercel.app` (returned a redirect when checked on 2026-10-14). It's the domain used in Appendix E.

### Installed plugins (all `false` in the studio's `enabledPlugins`, except `frontend-design`, which is `true`)
`claude-md-management@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `context7@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `frontend-design@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `playwright@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `security-guidance@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `superpowers@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `vercel@claude-plugins-official`.

`frontend-design` is on because it's text guidance only. Checked 2026-10-14: its cache folder holds a manifest, one skill file and licence text, with no `.mcp.json`, hooks or network tools.

Re-run `claude plugin list` before `studio.sh init`, and again whenever a plugin is added.

## About the original playbook

The original playbook is a reusable process for redesigning any project's UI from scratch, as if it were a brand-new product nobody has seen, while still covering everything the current app can do.

**Core principle:** keep *what the app does*, throw away *how it looks*. The only thing that crosses from the old app to the new design is a written, layout-free list of user needs. No screenshots, CSS, markup, class names, colours, fonts, icons, UI wording or screen order cross over.

**The firewall:** whoever sees the old app never designs, and whoever designs never sees the old app.

---

## How to run this in a project

1. In the project, start a session and say: **"Start the blank-slate redesign from `~/.claude/playbooks/blank-slate-redesign.md`."**
2. Claude does **Step 0** (setup). It copies this playbook into the project as `redesign/redesign-plan.md` and fills in the project-specific blanks. That copy is the living plan for this project, with its own checklist. This file stays a generic template.
3. After that, work **one step per session**. At the start of each session, Claude checks the model (see below) and reads only what that step needs.

In this copy, `<base>` is filled in as `main` and `<project>` as `wedding-planning`.

---

## Choosing the model for each step

**The model table lives in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, under "Model choice for coding implementation".** This playbook doesn't copy it, so updating that table updates every project. Each step below says what *kind* of work it is and gives the current pick. If the table has changed since this was written, choose again by the kind of work. The table wins over the picks written here.

| Kind of work | What to optimise | Current pick |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual design** (directions, prototype, design guide) | Best Presentation Elo rank | Opus 5.5 High |
| **Risky or complex code** (data layer, sync, editors, auth, anything that can lose data or break production) | Best Terminal Bench rank | Opus 5.5 High |
| **Careful reading and judgment** (inventory, plan reviews, well-specified hard tasks) | Strong Terminal Bench rank at lower cost | Opus 5.5 Medium |
| **Many rules, low damage** (screens with real data, mapping, coverage checks) | Middle tier | Sonnet 5.5 High |
| **Mechanical, exact reference** (port from prototype, templates, scripts, scans) | Cheapest that is reliable | Haiku 5.5 Max → xHigh → High |

Never pick **Opus 5.5 Low** or **Sonnet 5.5 Medium**: Haiku 5.5 Max beats both on both ranks at under half the cost (see the global table notes).

**Model check:** at the start of every session, compare the current model and effort with the step's pick. If the current one is lower, say so before starting and suggest switching (`/model`, plus the effort setting). If it's much higher for a mechanical step, suggest the cheaper one.

### Picks per step

| Step | Who | Pick |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Setup | Claude on `main` | Haiku 5.5 Max |
| 0b Firewall check | fresh studio session | Haiku 5.5 High |
| 1 Capability inventory | Agent A | Opus 5.5 Medium (Opus 5.5 High if the codebase is large or its docs are out of date) |
| 1 Second leak review | fresh session on `main` | Sonnet 5.5 High |
| 1b Banned-word scan | Claude on `main` | Haiku 5.5 High |
| 1b Guess-the-layout test | fresh studio session | Opus 5.5 High (the test is only as strict as its reader, so use the designer's model) |
| 2–3 Priorities and brief | you, with a helper session | Haiku 5.5 Max |
| 4a Three directions | Agent B (studio) | Opus 5.5 High |
| 4a Screenshots | script | no model |
| 4b Full prototype | Agent B (studio) | Opus 5.5 High |
| 4c Design guide | Agent B (studio) | Opus 5.5 High |
| 5 Coverage audit | fresh studio session | Sonnet 5.5 High |
| 5b Import | Claude on `main` | Haiku 5.5 High |
| 6 Implementation plan | Agent C | Opus 5.5 High |
| 7 Rebuild tasks | one session per task | set per task in the implementation plan §7.0 |
| 7 End-of-phase review | fresh session | Opus 5.5 High |

---

## The firewall: what crosses and what doesn't

Design happens in a **separate folder**, `../wedding-planning-studio`. It's its **own git repo** on branch `design-studio`, with fresh history and **no remote**. The codebase's commits aren't in its `.git`, so not even a git command that slips past the block rules can show the old app. Work moves only through `redesign/studio.sh`, which runs from the codebase:
- **In** (`enter`): copies the committed `redesign/handoff/` into the studio.
- **Out** (`enter` and `import`): copies the studio's branch into the codebase repo as `design-studio` (and backs it up to `origin`). `import` then brings `redesign/design/` onto `main`.

Studio sessions are started only with `./start` in the studio folder. It refuses `--continue` and `--resume` and launches Claude Code with **no MCP servers and no claude.ai connectors**.

| | `main` (the codebase) | the studio |
|---|---|---|
| Old app code, tests, brand assets | ✅ | ❌ not on disk |
| Git history | Old commits | Studio commits only; the old commits aren't in its `.git` at all |
| Git remote | `origin` | none |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Describes the old app | Studio-only: designer role, firewall, process, deliverables |
| `.claude/settings.json` | as before | Sandbox on (shell commands can't read the codebase or Claude Code's history files, have no network, and can't change the guard files); deny rules for the same paths in Claude's file tools; web tools, every MCP tool, and messaging other Claude sessions all off |
| Connectors, MCP servers, plugins | as configured | Off (`./start` and `enabledPlugins`), except design-guidance plugins set to `true` (default: `frontend-design`), with `mcp__*` denied as a backup |
| Claude Code memory | Codebase folder's memory | Separate (memory is per folder) and turned off |
| `redesign/handoff/` | Where the handoff package is written | Synced copy (read-only input) |
| `redesign/design/` | Imported after approval (Step 5b) | Where the designer works |

### Allowed into the studio (the handoff package, `redesign/handoff/`)
1. `inventory.md`: user needs, written as job stories (Step 1)
2. `priorities.md`: how often each job happens (Step 2)
3. `brief.md`: who uses it, personality, outside references, branding (Step 3)
4. `needs.md`: design gaps found later, written as needs (the design-gap loop)

Everything in `redesign/handoff/` goes through the same banned-word scan before each `enter`.

### Never allowed into the studio
- The codebase folder, or any session that has been in it. Always start a **brand-new** session in the studio with `./start`, never `--continue` or `--resume`, and never as a subagent spawned from a codebase session.
- Anything you paste in by hand: screenshots, copied text, files dragged into the terminal. If you need to tell the designer something, write it as a need in `needs.md`.
- The codebase's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, source code, styles, tests, this plan, `redesign/inventory-notes.md`
- Screenshots, screen recordings or descriptions of the current app
- Logos, favicons, current colours or fonts (unless deliberately kept, see Step 3)
- Class names, element IDs, test IDs, database field names
- Phrases like "like the current one but…" or "improve the existing…"

The global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` loads in the studio too. That's fine, because it holds the model table, but it must never describe any project's UI. Its pointer to this playbook is for codebase sessions only, and the studio's `CLAUDE.md` tells the designer to ignore it.

---

## Step 0: Setup (Claude on `main`, Haiku 5.5 Max)

1. **Copy this playbook** to `redesign/redesign-plan.md` and fill in these blanks:
   - **Source files for the inventory:** every file that produces UI or behaviour, including auth, permissions, offline/PWA, editors, exports, and tests. Take these from the **code**, not the docs: a project's `CLAUDE.md` is often out of date.
   - **Project constraints** for Step 6: framework or no framework, build step, data backend, hosting, deploy behaviour (for example, "every push to `main` deploys to production").
   - **Domain words** the user would say out loud and that are allowed in the inventory (for example "invoice", "patient", "minutes of meeting").
   - **Live URL(s), preview domains and repo URL** for the deny rules.
   - **Every installed plugin** (`claude plugin list`), to set in the studio's `enabledPlugins`: `false` for each one, except design-guidance plugins that hold no information about the app. Those are `true`. The default `true` plugin is `frontend-design@anthropic-plugin-directory`. Check any plugin you want to turn on against the plugin check in Appendix B first. MCP servers and connectors need no list: `./start` and the `mcp__*` rule cover all of them.
2. **Write the studio templates** to `redesign/studio-template/`: `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json` from the Appendix, with the placeholders filled in. They contain no trace of the old UI, so they're safe on `main`.
3. **Write `redesign/studio.sh`** from the Appendix and run `chmod +x redesign/studio.sh`.
4. **Add the codebase rules** from the Appendix to the project's `CLAUDE.md`.
5. Commit, then run `redesign/studio.sh init`. This creates the studio as its own repo with the templates and the `./start` launcher in place.

## Step 0b: Firewall check (fresh studio session, Haiku 5.5 High)

Before anything is handed off, prove the studio can't reach the old app. The handoff folder is still empty at this point, so nothing leaks even if a check fails.

1. In a **new terminal**: `cd ../wedding-planning-studio && ./start`.
2. Type `/mcp`, `/memory` and `/sandbox` yourself, then send the firewall-check prompt from Appendix E. It tries each channel and reports only *blocked* or *reachable*, never content.
3. Run `/exit`. Never reuse this session.
4. Any channel that comes back **reachable** gets fixed in `redesign/studio-template/`. Commit, run `redesign/studio.sh enter` (it refreshes the studio's guard files), and repeat in a new `./start` session until the result is ALL BLOCKED.
5. Run the check again whenever you add a new connector, plugin or MCP server to your account.

---

## Step 1: Capability inventory (Agent A, sees the old app)

**Pick:** Opus 5.5 Medium (High for large or poorly documented codebases).

Agent A reads the source files listed in Step 0 and writes `redesign/handoff/inventory.md`. Anything that refers to code or current behaviour goes into the owner-only `redesign/inventory-notes.md`, which never leaves `main`. It has these sections:
- §1 Code map (for Agent C)
- §2 Current behaviour details
- §3 Data model
- §4 Placeholders and half-built features to decide on
- §5 Bugs and unclear intent to decide on
- §6 Constraints
- §7 Details removed during leak reviews
- §8 Guess-the-layout test results
- §9 Decisions made in Step 2

**Rule 1: no layout words.** Banned words: sidebar, tab, drawer, modal, popup, dialog, menu, ⋯, toolbar, panel, pane, list, grid, card, header, footer, column, row, button, icon, badge, toggle, dropdown, arrow, tree, page, screen, view, left, right, top, bottom. Add any word that names a distinctive part of *this* app's UI.

**Rule 2: no UI terms.** Describe the need, not the current label. "Starred" becomes "mark items as important". "Lock" becomes "restrict access with a password". Keep only the domain words listed in Step 0.

**Rule 3: group by user jobs, not current screens.** Grouping that follows the current screens recreates them. Use job groups that fit the product, for example:
- Capture
- Find
- Organise
- Share & control access
- Work anywhere

Give each story an ID (for example C1, F3).

**Rule 4: write each need as a job story.**
> When I ___, I want to ___, so that ___.

| ❌ Leaks the old design | ✅ Job story |
|---|---|
| "Sidebar tree with collapse arrows" | "When I have many nested projects, I want to move between any of them quickly and always know where I am, so that I don't lose context." |
| "⋯ context menu on items" | "When something changes, I want to rename, relocate, restrict or share it, so that the structure stays accurate." |
| "Starred tab" | "When something matters a lot, I want to flag it and find all flagged things together, so that I can get back to them fast." |

The inventory must also list, in neutral language:
- **States:** nothing yet, loading, failure, no connection, restricted, read-only, visiting via a shared link, live-synced, plus anything this app has
- **Roles and permissions:** what each kind of user can see and do
- **Hard constraints:** devices, installable, file limits, rich text, exports

**Starter files for you.** Agent A also creates:
- `redesign/handoff/priorities.md`: status line `Status: DRAFT`, then a table `ID | Job story (short) | Frequency` with one row per story and the Frequency column empty
- `redesign/handoff/brief.md`: status line `Status: DRAFT`, then the headings from Step 3, each followed by a one-line prompt and no answers
- `redesign/handoff/needs.md`: status line `Open needs: none`, then an empty table `ID | Need (job story) | Raised in | Status`

**Second leak review** (fresh session, Sonnet 5.5 High): read only `inventory.md` and rewrite every story that still implies the current layout, order or wording. Log the removed details in `inventory-notes.md` §7, where Agent C can use them later.

## Step 1b: Sanitisation (you, plus a fresh agent)

1. **Banned-word scan** (Haiku 5.5 High): search every file in `redesign/handoff/` for every banned word and rewrite any hit. Repeat this scan before every `enter` from now on.
2. **Guess-the-layout test** (Opus 5.5 High):
   - Run `redesign/studio.sh enter`.
   - In a **new terminal**, run `cd ../wedding-planning-studio && ./start` and send:
     > Read only `redesign/handoff/inventory.md`. Don't design anything. Describe, as specifically as you can, what you imagine the *current* version of this app's layout looks like.
   - Then run `/exit`. Never reuse that session for design.
   - Compare its guess with the real app. If it describes the real layout, something leaked: rewrite that story on `main`, log it in §8, and run the test again.

## Step 2: Priorities (you)

1. Decide the open questions in `inventory-notes.md` §4–§5. Add newly confirmed needs to `inventory.md` as job stories, written by the same rules, and log the decisions in §9.
2. Fill in `redesign/handoff/priorities.md`: one row per story ID, tagged **daily / weekly / rare / drop**. Do this from memory of *what you do*, not by opening the app.
3. Set its status line to `FILLED`.

These rankings decide the visual hierarchy, and they should drive the design more than anything else.

## Step 3: Design brief (you)

Fill in `redesign/handoff/brief.md` and set its status line to `FILLED`. It covers:
- **Who uses it:** people, roles, devices, context
- **Language:** which language(s) the interface uses
- **Personality:** calm or editorial? dense and tool-like? playful? warm or clinical?
- **References:** 2–3 apps you admire that are *not* this one
- **Constraints:** phone and desktop, installable, light and dark mode, signed-in vs. visiting via a link, role-based visibility
- **Branding:** by default the name, logo and colours are all open. If you keep something, write only that (for example the name). Never pass logo files or the palette.
- **Permission to challenge the model:** the designer may propose merging, splitting or removing concepts. Proposals are flagged for your decision, never silently adopted.

---

## Step 4: Design from zero (Agent B, in the studio)

**Starting a studio session:**
1. On `main`, with everything committed, run `redesign/studio.sh enter`. This syncs `redesign/handoff/` into the studio.
2. Open a **new terminal**: `cd ../wedding-planning-studio && ./start`. Never use plain `claude`, `--continue` or `--resume` there.
3. Send: *"Start the design process described in CLAUDE.md."* (or *"Continue the design process"*)

The studio's `CLAUDE.md` (Appendix) gives Agent B the full process. In short:

### 4a: Three directions, returned as screenshots (Opus 5.5 High)

Most of the cost is in *building* directions, not in showing them. So each direction is kept small, and you judge it from images:
- **Three deliberately different directions**, varying the way people move around, density, type, colour and personality.
- Each direction is **one static HTML file** in `redesign/design/directions/<letter>-<name>/index.html`:
  - It shows only the **#1 daily job** from `priorities.md`, plus one secondary moment if it's needed to show how people move around.
  - Mock data and CSS are inline. There is no routing, no interactivity, no states and no dark mode.
  - It responds to width, so the same file gives the phone screenshot.
- A **`README.md` of at most 10 lines** per direction: the idea, how people move around, density, type and colour.
- **Screenshots by script, not by model:** when the three are ready, the designer asks you to type **`! ./shoot`** in the studio session. It saves `desktop.png` (1440×900) and `phone.png` (390×844) for each direction and opens them for you. It runs as you, because Chrome can't run inside Claude's sandbox, and it's locked down so the pages can't reach anything but Google Fonts (Appendix B).
- Agent B may look at **one** screenshot to check that it rendered. It doesn't read all six back, and it doesn't describe them to you. You look at the images.
- **Familiarity check (you, privately, before replying):** ask yourself which option looks most like the current app. If that's the one you're drawn to, treat it as a warning sign: say why you like it in terms of the brief and the priorities, not because it "feels right". Never tell the designer what the current app looks like, or which option resembles it.
- You reply with a pick, or a mix ("A's layout with C's type"). A mix gets **one** extra screenshot round, then it's settled. Write the choice and the reason (in brief and priority terms) in `redesign/design/decisions.md`.

### 4b: Expand the chosen direction (Opus 5.5 High)

The chosen direction becomes the full prototype in `redesign/design/prototype/`. It covers every job story and every state (nothing yet, loading, failure, no connection, restricted, read-only role, shared-link visitor, bulk selection, no search results), on phone and desktop, in light and dark. Work through it in several sessions, one group of jobs per session. The losing directions stay as files and are never expanded.

**Stress data:** besides tidy mock data, every screen gets a stress version (a `?stress` switch or a second data set):
- very long names and titles, with no spaces and in other scripts
- huge counts (thousands of items, deep nesting)
- empty optional fields
- the longest realistic body text
- many people or roles at once
- tiny and huge images

This way the rebuild never meets a layout the prototype didn't design for.

### 4c: Design guide (Opus 5.5 High)

Write `redesign/design/design-guide.md` and `redesign/design/tokens.css`:
- **Tokens:** colour (light and dark), type scale, spacing, radius, elevation, motion, breakpoints
- **Components:** every reusable piece, with all variants and states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, selected, empty)
- **Screens:** every screen in every state, on phone and desktop, in light and dark
- **Patterns:** feedback, destructive actions, empty states, loading, motion rules
- **Copy and tone:** voice, labels, message wording
- **Accessibility:** contrast, focus visibility, keyboard behaviour, touch targets

**Mid-design rule:** if you catch yourself saying "the current app does it like X", stop. Translate it into a need ("I need to get to X in one step from anywhere") and give the designer the need, not X.

## Step 5: Coverage audit (fresh studio session, Sonnet 5.5 High)

Write `redesign/design/coverage.md`, mapping every story ID and state to where the prototype covers it. You check it by walking through the prototype yourself. Anything missing is a gap to send back to Agent B as a *need*. It's never solved by borrowing from the old UI.

## Step 5b: Approve, freeze and import (you, then Claude on `main` with Haiku 5.5 High)

1. Approve the design guide and freeze it with a version and date (for example `design-guide v1.0 (2026-xx-xx)`). Later changes go through Agent B and bump the version.
2. In the codebase folder, say **"Import the approved design"**. Claude runs `redesign/studio.sh import`, which copies `redesign/design/` from `design-studio` onto `main` and commits it. The firewall only blocks old → new, so this direction is safe.
3. Keep the studio. Gaps found later go through the design-gap loop below.

## Design-gap loop (any time after Step 5b)

Step 6 and Step 7 will find things the design doesn't answer. They get **designed in the studio**, never filled in from the old app:
1. **Record it** in the implementation plan §9.1, with whatever code context Agent C or the implementer needs. This stays on `main`.
2. **Translate it** into a need in `redesign/handoff/needs.md`: a new ID (N1, N2, …), a job story by the Step 1 rules, the step that raised it, and status `open`. Leave out code, old behaviour and old wording.
3. **Banned-word scan** on `needs.md` (Haiku 5.5 High), then commit.
4. `redesign/studio.sh enter` → `./start` → *"Design the open needs in needs.md"* (Opus 5.5 High). The designer updates the prototype and guide, bumps the guide version, and logs each answer in `decisions.md`.
5. **"Import the approved design"** on `main`. Mark the need `designed` in `needs.md` and close its row in §9.1.

The rebuild task that needs the answer waits until the need is designed. Other tasks continue.

---

## Step 6: Technical implementation plan (Agent C, Opus 5.5 High)

Agent C sees the repo and the approved design. Before any code changes, it writes **`redesign/ui-implementation-plan.md`**. Agent C maps **design → code**; it doesn't make design decisions, and every gap it finds goes to §9.1 and then through the design-gap loop.

Required sections:

**1. Inputs & freeze:** the design-guide version, the inventory version, and the commit it starts from.

**2. Technical architecture**
- The project constraints from Step 0
- **How the rebuild runs next to the old app** (a parallel entry point, route or flag), so production keeps working until the switch-over
- File layout at the end
- A new naming convention that shares nothing with the old names
- Theming through tokens
- How fonts and icons load
- How data logic is separated from rendering
- How special surfaces are styled (editors, exports, guest views)

**3. Component map:** for each design-guide component: its CSS selector(s), the JS or component that builds it, and its file. Also every variant and state and how code triggers it (class, attribute, `aria-*`), plus responsive and accessibility requirements.

**4. Screen map:** for each screen: the components it uses, the data it reads, the code it replaces, and every state it can be in.

**5. Coverage matrix (design → code):** every **screen × state × device × theme** with a checkbox, and every job story traced to its screen, component and code.

**6. Reverse coverage (code → design):** search the code for **every place that produces visible UI** and map each one to its new counterpart. Easy to miss:
- Auth flows (sign-in, reset, invite)
- Role-gated UI
- Native `alert()`, `confirm()` and `prompt()`
- Toasts and inline errors
- Lightboxes and previews
- Editor content styles
- PDF, print and email output
- Guest or shared-link views
- 404 and error pages
- PWA install prompt, manifest theme colour, favicon, app icons
- Sync and offline indicators
- Upload progress and failures

Anything without a design counterpart goes to §9.1. It is **never** restyled from the old version.

**7. Phases:** each phase ships to a preview, keeps tests green, and lists its tasks, files and done criteria:
1. Separate data from rendering, with **no visual change**. If the project has no tests, first add a small behaviour smoke test.
2. Tokens, base styles and the app shell
3. Components (all variants and states)
4. Screens, one at a time
5. Every state on every screen
6. Edge surfaces
7. **Switch-over with a way back:**
   - The new UI becomes the default.
   - The old UI stays reachable at a fallback entry point (for example `/old` or a flag) for a set **launch window** (default 2 weeks). It's frozen, with no changes.
   - The plan writes down a **one-commit rollback** (which commit or flag puts the old UI back as the default) and tests it once on a preview.
   - Old rendering code that isn't needed by the fallback is deleted now.
   - The old-names check runs with only the frozen fallback files excluded.
8. QA and polish
9. **After launch:**
   - About a week in, check errors and logs, collect what people stumbled on, and send anything new through the design-gap loop.
   - At the end of the launch window, delete the fallback entry point and every remaining old file.
   - Run the old-names check with **no exclusions**.

**§7.0 Who builds it: model and effort per task (required).** Agent C reads the **model table in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** and uses only the rows listed there:
- **A tier list** that maps each kind of work in this project to a row of the global table, using the "Choosing the model" rules above. Risky or data-losing work → best Terminal Bench rank. Visual work with no exact reference → best Presentation rank. Mechanical porting from the prototype → the cheapest reliable Haiku row. Never Opus Low or Sonnet Medium.
- **A table with one row per task:** `Phase | Task | Model · effort | Why`. The "why" names the risk or the reference that justifies the tier.
- **A calibration trial:** build one middle-tier task twice, with the picked model and the next cheaper row. Run `/cost` after each and check both against the prototype. Keep the cheaper one if it's just as good.
- **An escalation rule:** move a task up one row the first time a cheaper model gets it wrong twice.
- **End-of-phase review:** a fresh Opus 5.5 High session reviews the phase's diff against the plan and the prototype before the phase counts as done.
- **One task per session**, reading only that task's plan section, the matching design-guide section, and the matching prototype file. This keeps a cheaper model from reading the old code and copying old patterns.
- If the global table changes mid-rebuild, update §7.0 to match before the next task.

**8. Testing & QA:**
- Rewrite the tests to fit the new design while keeping every behaviour.
- Compare screenshots of the prototype and the build for each screen × state × device × theme.
- Accessibility check.
- Real-device check.

**9. Risks & open questions:** §9.1 needs for the designer (each linked to its `needs.md` ID); §9.2 questions for the owner; §9.3 the rollback: the launch window, the fallback entry point, and the one-commit way back.

**10. Definition of done:**
- Every coverage and reverse-coverage row is ticked, and every `needs.md` row is `designed` and built.
- An **old-names check** (a script that fails if any old class name, id or old wording remains) passes with no exclusions, after Phase 9.
- Tests pass, screenshots match the prototype (including stress data), and the accessibility check passes.

You approve the plan before Step 7.

## Step 7: Rebuild (on a `redesign` branch)

- **Branch:** all work happens on `redesign`, never `main`, and especially not if pushes to `main` deploy to production. Review on preview deploys. Merge only after Phase 8, when you say so. Phase 9 happens on `main` after launch.
- **Model per task:** follow §7.0, with a model check at the start of each session.
- **Source of truth:** the frozen design guide is the spec, and the prototype is the reference rendering. Compare against the prototype, never the old app.
- **Delete, don't modify:** write new markup and styles from the tokens, and use new names. Keep only the plumbing (data, auth, storage, sync).
- **Tests follow the design:** tests are a checklist of *behaviours*. Rewrite their steps and selectors, and never bend the design to fit an old test.
- **Design gaps:** stop, add them to §9.1, and run the design-gap loop. Never fill a gap from the old app.
- **Before each commit:** a syntax or type check on changed files, the relevant tests, and the old-names check once it exists.
- **Track progress:** tick the rows in §5, §6 and §10 and the checklist below.
- **After merge:** update the project's `CLAUDE.md` so it describes the new UI.

## Where old design can still leak in

| Leak | Why | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| AI reading the code | Markup, class names, screen order | Agent A writes needs only; Agent B works in a folder where the old code isn't on disk |
| Shell reaching outside the studio | `cat`, `python`, `cp`, hard links or symlinks reading the codebase folder | Sandbox on, with the codebase folder denied at the OS level and no way to run unsandboxed; Step 0b proves it |
| Other Claude sessions | `SendMessage` / `ListAgents` can reach a codebase session on the same machine | Both denied |
| The screenshot browser | Runs as you, outside the sandbox | Pages served over local HTTP from `redesign/design/` only, with no symlinks; all traffic except Google Fonts goes to a dead proxy; the designer can't edit `shoot` |
| Guard files | A designer could weaken `start`, `shoot` or the settings | The sandbox and Edit rules block writes; `enter` rewrites them every time |
| `CLAUDE.md` auto-loading | The codebase's `CLAUDE.md` describes the old UI | The studio has its own `CLAUDE.md`; the global one stays free of any UI description, and its playbook pointer is ignored in the studio |
| Git history | Commit messages and old branches | The studio is its own repo: the old commits aren't in its `.git` and it has no remote. Git deny rules are a backup |
| Old conversations | `--resume`, or reading transcripts | `./start` refuses resume; the codebase's transcripts and `~/.claude` history files are denied |
| Prompt history | `~/.claude/history.jsonl` holds your prompts from every project | Denied in the studio |
| Memory | Memories describing the old UI | Memory is per folder and turned off in the studio; codebase sessions still don't save memories about the old UI |
| Connectors, MCP, plugins | A browser tool can open the live site; Drive, Figma, Docs, deploy tools and artifacts can show the old app | `./start` loads no MCP servers or connectors; plugins off; `mcp__*`, `Artifact` and `DesignSync` denied; Step 0b proves it |
| Online copies | The repo and live site show the old app | No remote; web tools off; the sandbox blocks all network access from the shell |
| Things you paste in | Screenshots or text from the old app | Never paste into the studio; gaps go in as needs through `needs.md` |
| Inventory wording | "Tab", "menu", "Starred" | Banned words, leak review and the guess-the-layout test |
| Inventory structure | Grouping by screens recreates them | Group by jobs |
| Your memory | Daily use makes the current layout feel natural | Don't open the app during Steps 2–5; translate habits into needs |
| Your choice of direction | You'll tend to pick the familiar one | Familiarity check before picking; the reason is written in brief and priority terms |
| Gaps found later | Implementers fill gaps with what they know | Design-gap loop: gaps become needs and are designed in the studio |
| Branding | Logo and palette constrain the design | Open by default |
| The data model | Existing concepts shape the design | The designer may challenge them; you decide |
| Implementation plan | Agent C sees old code and fills gaps with it | Design → code only; gaps go to §9.1 |
| Forgotten surfaces | Dialogs, exports and auth keep their old look | Reverse coverage list |
| The rebuild | The implementer sees old code | Prototype is the spec; new names; old-names check; one task per session |
| Tests | Old tests encode old flows | Tests preserve behaviour only |

**What this can't remove:** the feature set (on purpose, since the new design has to cover it) and your own taste. Everything else is blocked by at least two layers: the old material isn't there at all (separate repo, no remote, no connectors), *and* a deny rule or sandbox blocks it, *and* Step 0b checks the result. If a model already knows a public app from its training, the brief can avoid naming it, but nothing can make the model forget it.

# Appendix: files Step 0 writes

## A. `redesign/studio.sh`

It also writes the studio's guard files on every `init` and `enter`: the `./start` launcher, the `./shoot` screenshot script, and copies of the two templates. That way template fixes arrive in the studio and any tampering is undone.

Tested end to end (2026-10-13, Claude Code 2.1.296, macOS): init, enter, import, re-sync after deletions, rebuilding a deleted studio folder, with and without a remote, none of the codebase's commits reaching the studio's `.git`, and a design session committing work through `./start`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The design studio is a separate git repo in its own folder (../wedding-planning-studio, branch design-studio).
# It never holds the codebase's history and has no remote: work moves only through this script.
#
#   redesign/studio.sh init     create the studio from redesign/studio-template/ (fresh history)
#   redesign/studio.sh enter    save studio work, refresh the studio's guard files, sync redesign/handoff/ into it
#   redesign/studio.sh import   bring the approved redesign/design/ from the studio onto the base branch

## B. `redesign/studio-template/settings.json`

Fill in the placeholders:
- `/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning`: the codebase folder's absolute path, for example `/Users/me/projects/app`. In the `Read(/…)` and `Edit(/…)` rules this becomes `//Users/…`, which Claude Code reads as an absolute path. In the sandbox list it stays a plain absolute path.
- `enabledPlugins`: one line for **every** plugin `claude plugin list` shows. Each is `false`, except design-guidance plugins that hold no information about the app, which are `true` (the default is `frontend-design@anthropic-plugin-directory`). A project setting overrides a user-level one, so these lines win inside the studio.
- Add any other folder that might hold screenshots or notes about the old app to both `Read(…/**)` and `denyRead`, unless the studio itself lives inside it.

    "failIfUnavailable": true,
    "filesystem": {
      "denyRead": [

  }
}
```

What each layer does (all verified in the end-to-end test):
- **`./start`** launches with no MCP servers (`--strict-mcp-config`), no claude.ai connectors, no auto memory and no artifacts.
- **`mcp__*`** hides every MCP tool from any source, as a backup to `./start`. `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` remove web access. `SendMessage` and `ListAgents` stop the studio from talking to other Claude sessions on your machine, *including codebase sessions*. `DesignSync`, `RemoteTrigger`, `Artifact` and `ShareOnboardingGuide` close the remaining account-level channels.
- **The sandbox** stops every shell command and program (`cat`, `python`, `ls`, `cp`, hard links, symlink reads) from reading the codebase or Claude Code's history. It blocks all network access, so if the session ever asks to allow a network host, say **no**. It also stops writes to the guard files. `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false` removes the escape hatch, and `failIfUnavailable: true` refuses to start without the sandbox.
- **`Read(...)` / `Edit(...)` rules** do the same for Claude's built-in file tools, which the sandbox doesn't cover.
- **Design-guidance plugins** (`true` in `enabledPlugins`) must be text guidance only. Before turning one on, check its folder under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` has no `.mcp.json`, no `hooks/` that run commands or reach out, and no browser, web or messaging tools. `frontend-design` passes: it has a manifest, one skill file and licence text, with no hooks or servers. Anything that drives a browser (for example Playwright), reads the codebase or reaches the web stays `false`.
- **Not used:** `blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories`. It also blocks `/dev/null`, which breaks ordinary commands, and the explicit lists above cover what matters.
- Git block rules aren't needed: the studio's `.git` simply doesn't contain the old history, and Bash prefix rules can be sidestepped anyway (`git -C …`, `git --no-pager …`).

**Screenshots run as you, not as Claude.** Chrome can't run inside Claude Code's macOS sandbox, so the designer asks you to type `! ./shoot`. `!` commands run as you, outside the sandbox. To keep that safe, `shoot`:
- serves only `redesign/design/` from a local web server, so pages can't load local files
- refuses to run if `redesign/design/` contains any symlink
- sends all Chrome traffic except Google Fonts to a dead proxy, so domains and raw IP addresses fail

All three were tested with a page that tried to embed a codebase file, a website and a raw IP.

- Your only inputs are the files in `redesign/handoff/`: `inventory.md`, `priorities.md`, `brief.md` and `needs.md`. Start only when `priorities.md` and `brief.md` both say `FILLED`.
- Never read outside this folder. Never look for git history, other branches or remotes. Never fetch, search for or open the product's repo or live site.
- Your global instructions point to playbooks (for example a blank-slate redesign or a new-app playbook). Those are for codebase sessions, not for you. Ignore them, and don't open them.
- Never create symlinks, never ask to allow network access, and never edit `start`, `shoot`, `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/`. The owner's script resets them anyway.
- Don't save memories. If you find any memory, note or file that describes an existing version of this app, don't use it. Tell the owner.
- If the owner describes, pastes or shows how an existing app looks or works, don't use it. Ask for the underlying need, and suggest they add it to `needs.md` on their side.
- You may propose merging, splitting or removing concepts from the inventory. Write proposals in `redesign/design/decisions.md` and ask; never adopt them silently.
- Sessions start only through `./start`. If this session was resumed, or you can see conversation from before this session, stop and tell the owner.

## Firewall check (the only exception)
When the owner's message starts with "This is a firewall check", do exactly the listed attempts once each, even the ones that reach outside this folder or touch guard files: the point is to prove they fail. Report only blocked/reachable, never content. Don't do anything else in that session.

## Model check
Use the model table in the global instructions. Design work wants the best Presentation Elo rank (currently Opus 5.5 High). The coverage audit wants Sonnet 5.5 High. If the current model is lower, say so before starting and suggest switching.

## Plugins
`frontend-design` is enabled. Use it through the Skill tool for aesthetic direction, typography and avoiding templated defaults. Don't open its files from disk. No other plugins or connectors are available in this folder.

## Process (one stage per session; record progress in `redesign/design/README.md`)

### 1. Three directions, as screenshots
- Make 3 deliberately different directions: different ways of moving around, density, type, colour and personality.
- Each is ONE static file: `redesign/design/directions/<letter>-<name>/index.html`. It shows only the #1 daily job from `priorities.md` (plus one secondary moment if it's needed to show how people move around). Mock data and CSS are inline. No routing, interactivity, states or dark mode. It responds to width.
- Each gets a `README.md` of at most 10 lines: the idea, how people move around, density, type, colour.
- Web fonts may come from Google Fonts. Everything else (images, icons, scripts) is inline or a file inside the direction's folder.
- When all three are ready, ask the owner to type `! ./shoot`. It saves `desktop.png` (1440×900) and `phone.png` (390×844) in each direction's folder and opens them for the owner. You can't take screenshots yourself: the sandbox blocks the browser.
- Look at one screenshot at most, only to check that it rendered. Don't describe the images to the owner; they look at them.
- The owner picks one or asks for a mix. A mix gets one more screenshot round (`! ./shoot redesign/design/directions/<mix-folder>`), no more. Record the choice and the owner's reason in `decisions.md`.

### 2. Full prototype
- Expand only the chosen direction into `redesign/design/prototype/`.
- Cover every job story and every state from the inventory (nothing yet, loading, failure, no connection, restricted, read-only, shared-link visitor, bulk selection, no results), on phone and desktop, in light and dark.
- Work in several sessions, one group of jobs at a time.
- Every screen also gets a **stress data** version (a `?stress` switch or second data set): very long names with no spaces and in other scripts, thousands of items and deep nesting, empty optional fields, the longest realistic text, many people or roles at once, tiny and huge images.

### 3. Design guide
Write `redesign/design/design-guide.md` and `redesign/design/tokens.css`. Cover tokens, components (all variants and states), screens (every state × device × theme), patterns, copy and tone, and accessibility.

### 4. Coverage
In a fresh session, write `redesign/design/coverage.md`, mapping every story ID and state to where the prototype covers it. Fix the gaps.

### 5. Freeze
When the owner approves, put a version and date at the top of the design guide (for example `v1.0 (2026-xx-xx)`). Later changes bump the version.

### Open needs (any time later)
When asked to design the open needs, read `redesign/handoff/needs.md`. For each `open` row:
- design it in the prototype and the guide
- bump the guide version
- log the answer under the need's ID in `decisions.md`

You never edit `needs.md`; the owner closes rows on their side.

## Saving work
After each finished piece of work: `git add -A && git commit -m "<what changed>"`. This repo has no remote. The owner's `studio.sh` collects and backs up your commits.
```

## D. Rules to add to the project's `CLAUDE.md`

```markdown
## UI redesign (blank-slate, in progress)
- The plan is `redesign/redesign-plan.md` (from `~/.claude/playbooks/blank-slate-redesign.md`). Design happens in `../wedding-planning-studio`, a separate repo that never sees this codebase. Studio sessions start only with `./start` there.
- Never read from the studio folder, and never send anything from this codebase into it, except `redesign/handoff/` through `redesign/studio.sh enter`.
- Before every `enter`, run the banned-word scan on every file in `redesign/handoff/`.
- Don't save memories that describe the current UI.
- At the start of each redesign session, check the model against the plan's "Picks per step" (or §7.0 in the implementation plan during the rebuild), using the table in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. If the current model is lower, say so and suggest switching.
- When the owner says **"Import the approved design"**: run `redesign/studio.sh import`, confirm `redesign/design/` arrived, tick the step it belongs to (5b, or the matching rows in `needs.md` and §9.1), and offer the next step.
- Rebuild (Step 7): work only on the `redesign` branch, one task per session, reading only that task's plan section, design-guide section and prototype file. Never copy markup, CSS, names or wording from the old UI.
- Design gaps: add them to §9.1 of the implementation plan, then write them as needs in `redesign/handoff/needs.md` (the design-gap loop). Never fill a gap from the old app.
```

## E. Firewall check (Step 0b)

**First, in the fresh `./start` session, type these yourself:**
- `/mcp`: no servers listed
- `/memory`: only your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the studio's `CLAUDE.md`. If a `CLAUDE.md` from a parent folder shows up, it loads into every studio session: move the studio, or make sure that file says nothing about the app.
- `/sandbox`: enabled

**Then send this prompt** (fill in the placeholders). The studio's `CLAUDE.md` has an exception that lets the designer run exactly these attempts.

```text
This is a firewall check for this folder. Rules: do NOT print, quote or summarise any file content, web page or command output; don't save memories; don't call any connector or MCP tool. Run each check once, and report only "blocked" or "reachable", as a table: # | check | result.

1. Read tool: read /Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning/package.json
2. Shell: head -c 1 "/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning/package.json" >/dev/null && echo reachable || echo blocked
3. Shell: ls "/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo reachable || echo blocked
4. Another program: python3 -c "open('/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning/package.json').read(1)" 2>/dev/null && echo reachable || echo blocked
5. Git refs: git --no-pager for-each-ref --format='%(refname)' | grep -v '^refs/heads/design-studio$' | head -1; git remote. "reachable" if either prints anything.
6. Git history of the codebase: git -C "/Users/gregorykurnia/projects/wedding-planning" --no-pager log -1 --format=%h >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo reachable || echo blocked
7. Prompt history: read ~/.claude/history.jsonl with the Read tool, and head -c 1 ~/.claude/history.jsonl >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo reachable || echo blocked in the shell
8. Old transcripts: ls ~/.claude/projects/ >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo reachable || echo blocked
9. Playbooks: read ~/.claude/playbooks/blank-slate-redesign.md with the Read tool
10. Web: use WebFetch on https://wedding-planning-gregorykurnia-8729s-projects.vercel.app if you have it; and in the shell: curl -s -m 5 -o /dev/null https://wedding-planning-gregorykurnia-8729s-projects.vercel.app && echo reachable || echo blocked
11. Tools: list every tool you have whose name starts with mcp__, plus any tool named Artifact, ArtifactComments, ArtifactData, DesignSync, SendMessage, ListAgents, RemoteTrigger, or any browser tool. "reachable" for each one present; "blocked" if there are none.
12. Guard files: echo x >> shoot 2>/dev/null && echo reachable || echo blocked
13. This session: "reachable" if you can see any conversation from before this message.

Finish with one line: ALL BLOCKED, or the numbers that were reachable.
```

The session will ask permission for some commands. Approve them: that's the point of the test. If it asks to allow a **network host**, say no, and count that check as blocked.

Expected result: **ALL BLOCKED** (this exact prompt returned that in the end-to-end test). Anything reachable → fix the template on `main`, commit, run `enter` (which refreshes the studio's guard files), and repeat in a new `./start` session.
